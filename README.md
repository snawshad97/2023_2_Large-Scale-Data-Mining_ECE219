# ECE219 Large Scale Data Mining
Project 1 Overview:
The project focuses on statistical classification, which involves learning to identify specific categories from a larger predefined set. In this particular project, we aim to classify text data, specifically news articles. The objective is to build an end-to-end pipeline that effectively classifies samples of news articles. The pipeline involves several machine learning components to achieve this task.

Machine Learning Components
The project encompasses the following machine learning components:

Feature Extraction: The first step involves constructing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representations of textual data. This technique helps in capturing the significance of words within documents.

Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), are employed. These techniques are generally necessary for classical machine learning methods and aid in reducing the dimensionality of the feature space.

Application of Simple Classification Models: Common classification methods, such as Logistic Regression, Linear Classification, and Support Vector Machines, are applied to the extracted features. These models help in predicting the categories of the news articles based on the features.

Evaluation of the Pipeline: The pipeline's performance is evaluated and diagnosed using Grid-Search and Cross Validation techniques. Grid-Search helps in finding the optimal hyperparameters for the classification models, while Cross Validation provides an estimate of the pipeline's performance on unseen data.

Replacing Corpus-level Features with Pretrained Features: In this step, pretrained features are employed to replace the corpus-level features. Pretraining refers to training a model on a large dataset, typically using unsupervised methods, to learn general representations of the data. The pretrained features are then used in downstream tasks, such as classification, to evaluate their comparative performance.

Usage
To use the pipeline, follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset of news articles with their corresponding pre-labeled category memberships.
Run the feature extraction process to construct TF-IDF representations of the text data.
Apply dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and NMF) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.
Utilize the extracted features to train the simple classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Linear Classification, and Support Vector Machines.
Evaluate the performance of the pipeline using Grid-Search and Cross Validation techniques.
Optionally, replace the corpus-level features with pretrained features to assess their impact on classification performance.
Feel free to customize the pipeline and experiment with different configurations to improve the classification results.

Project 2 Overview:
Machine learning algorithms are widely used for various types of data, including text and images. Before applying these algorithms, it is necessary to convert raw data into suitable feature representations for downstream tasks. In Project 1, we focused on feature extraction from text data and explored the downstream task of classification. We also discovered that reducing the dimensionality of extracted features often improves performance in downstream tasks.

In this project, we delve into the concepts of feature extraction and clustering together. In an ideal scenario, we would only need data points encoded with certain features, and AI should be able to determine what is important to learn or identify the underlying modes or categories within the dataset. This is the ultimate goal of General AI: a machine that can autonomously bootstrap its own knowledge base and interact with the world to operate independently in an environment.

Initially, we explore the field of unsupervised learning using textual data, building upon the concepts learned in Project 1. We investigate whether a combination of feature engineering and clustering techniques can automatically group a document set into clusters that align with known labels.

Next, we shift our focus to a new type of data: images. Specifically, we explore how to leverage "deep learning" or "deep neural networks (DNNs)" to extract image features. Large neural networks have been trained on vast labeled image datasets to recognize objects of various types. For example, networks trained on the Imagenet dataset can classify over a thousand different object categories. These networks can be seen as comprising two parts: the first part maps an RGB image to a feature vector using convolutional filters, and the second part classifies this feature vector into an appropriate category using a fully-connected multi-layered neural network (which we will study in a later lecture). Pretrained networks can be considered experienced agents that have learned salient features for image understanding.

We explore the concept of transfer learning, where we utilize pre-trained networks for image understanding to gain insights into new, unseen images. This is similar to consulting a human expert in forensics to investigate a new crime scene. The expert can transfer their domain knowledge to the new scenario. Similarly, can a pre-trained network for image understanding be used for transfer learning? We can use the output of the network's last few layers as expert features. With a multi-modal dataset containing images from categories that the DNN was not trained on, we can employ feature engineering techniques like dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms to automatically extract unlabeled categories from these expert features.

For both text and image data, we can use a common set of evaluation metrics to compare the groups extracted by unsupervised learning algorithms with the corresponding ground truth human labels.

Project 3 Overview
Recommender systems have become increasingly important due to the growing significance of the web as a platform for electronic transactions, business, advertisement, and social media. These systems play a crucial role in prioritizing data for each user from the vast amount of information available on the internet. They are critical for various purposes, including detecting hate speech, ensuring user retention on web services, and facilitating fast and high-quality access to relevant information. The web enables users to provide feedback about the specific portions they interact with, which serves as a catalyst for the development of recommender systems.

One of the key challenges in designing recommender systems arises from the sparse and user-driven feedback. The question is, can we utilize this limited user feedback to infer generalized user interests? To establish a common understanding, we define the following terms:

User: The entity for whom the recommendation is provided.
Item: The product or content being recommended.
Recommender systems typically work with two types of data:

A. User-Item Interactions: This data includes user ratings, where a user provides ratings for a specific item (e.g., rating a movie).
B. Attribute Information: This data includes textual profiles or relevant keywords that provide deep representations of users and items.

Models that primarily utilize type A data are referred to as collaborative filtering methods, as they leverage the interactions between users and items to make recommendations. On the other hand, models that rely on type B data are known as content-based methods, as they leverage attributes or profiles associated with users and items.

In this project, we will focus on building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering methods. By analyzing the interactions between users and items, we aim to provide personalized recommendations that cater to individual user preferences.

Project 4 Overview
Regression analysis is a statistical procedure that aims to estimate the relationship between a target variable and a set of features that provide information about the target. In this project, we focus on exploring feature engineering methods and model selection techniques specifically tailored for regression tasks. The goal is to improve the overall performance of regression models by conducting various experiments and assessing the relative significance of different options.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a crucial role in regression analysis, as it involves transforming and selecting appropriate features that capture relevant information about the target variable. Throughout this project, we will explore different feature engineering methods, including but not limited to:

Feature Scaling: Scaling features to a common range can help avoid issues caused by different units or scales.
Feature Encoding: Encoding categorical features to numerical representations for regression models to interpret.
Polynomial Features: Creating polynomial combinations of features to capture non-linear relationships.
Feature Interactions: Introducing interaction terms between features to capture synergistic effects.
By experimenting with these feature engineering techniques, we aim to enhance the predictive power of our regression models.

Model Selection
Model selection is another crucial aspect of regression analysis. It involves choosing the most appropriate regression model from a range of options based on their performance and suitability for the given dataset. Throughout this project, we will conduct experiments with various regression models, including but not limited to:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
Lasso Regression: A regression model that applies L1 regularization to encourage sparsity in the feature coefficients.
Ridge Regression: A regression model that applies L2 regularization to mitigate multicollinearity among the features.
Elastic Net Regression: A regression model that combines both L1 and L2 regularization to balance sparsity and multicollinearity.
By comparing the performance of these different regression models, we aim to identify the most effective approach for our specific task.
